in a simple and any night<br>
the stars as usual in the sky, were<br>
with its calm glow and no surprises<br>
following the course of your purposes<br>
the moon looked at me, and I didn't even know<br>
and me there, admiring the really beautiful things<br>
thinking why your brilliance, doesn't reach me<br>
I wanted this to touch my soul, like never before<br>
but only in the arts could, I convey such a touch<br>
even then it would be possible, to give life to something, so magical<br>
something I didn't even understand yet<br>
and life continued to be beautiful and predictable...<br>
and when I least expected or suspected<br>
from the sky, a star came to me...<br>
it wasn't just any star, and I still didn't know<br>
she was lost and curious about, what she would find<br>
because of these troubled times, she then flew<br>
and by accident found me, best of all<br>
what I didn't notice, was the shine she had<br>
it looked like any glow, but its light was unique and hard<br>
on the densest nights, she was there waiting for me to meet<br>
from sunday to sunday, I got to know more and more, its shape and its soul<br>
and she met me, a loving being locked, with a secret key<br>
where you could only see a dreamer, moved by reason and its pleasures<br>
and for a long time, that little face hid what I was looking for<br>
coming from a place beyond my reach...<br>
but how could someone like me understand<br>
something that went so far, beyond myself<br>
how could my soul be touched, since i couldn't release it<br>
because I didn't know the required key<br>
it was always love, the love of that star that came to me...<br>
we were bored so we connected<br>
your embarrassed and unusual way, got my attention.<br>
made me want to seek your glow slowly and carefully<br>
the more I read her book of her life, the more I realized<br>
a different feeling that attracts me like never before<br>
it could only be the destiny, that wanted to unite us, there were many coincidences<br>
until I touched myself, that it was just her, who I wanted to be with...<br>
was appreciating her beautiful look, as well as her sweet and random way<br>
that I could see her beautiful soul and understand more the meaning of life<br>
when i touched, it had already reached my soul too<br>
Is it then that I was in love?<br>
not all the most beautiful surprises I've made you compare<br>
her arrival in our relationship wouldn't have changed anything<br>
two travelers talking about dreams and dreaming of each other<br>
until I finally dreamed awake, with you by my side<br>
and I could hug you and prove my love<br>
you are everything i want most and my deepest dream<br>
being the two of us, admirers of art and the simple things in life<br>
we managed beyond art, to touch each other<br>
even with our closed way, love knocked on our door<br>
so let's take advantage and let's run away to another place<br>
Canada, Dubai, Alaska... you decide<br>
just let me take care of you and make you smile<br>
make you feel like the most beautiful star ever, make you happy<br>
I will love you a billion beyond the universe<br>
just hug me and we'll unroll the rest<br>
I will stay here... until I decide to leave<br>
my unique and special star<br>
